Priority Queue:
priority queue is a data structure that allows us to find minimum
maximum element among a collection of elements in constant time.
it supports following operations-

insert(key)):----insert a key into the priority queue.

deleteMax()/deleteMin()----return and remove largest/smallest key.

getMax()/getMin()----return largest/smallest key.


Binary Heap:
The binary heap is a data structure that helps is in implementing 
Priority queue operations efficiently. A binary heap is a complete binary tree
in which each node value is >= or <= than the values of its children.

Complete Binary Tree
A complete binary tree is a binary tree Where all levels are 
completely filled except last level and last level has nodes in such a way that left 
side is never empty.
